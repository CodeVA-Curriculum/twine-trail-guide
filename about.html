<p>This site is a guide intended to help people use (or teach others to use) <a href="https://twinery.org/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Twine</strong></a>. <strong>Twine</strong> is a tool for creating websites, but instead of the website being about a topic, or hosting a storefront, or containing blog posts, <strong>Twine</strong> websites tell <strong>stories</strong>.</p>
<p>This guide is specifically for Twine stories written in the <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/guide/" rel="nofollow">Chapbook</a> format. Many of the tutorials in here are based on the <a href="https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/guide/" rel="nofollow">Chapbook wiki</a>, which contains lots of great examples and additional information. Please read it if you want to learn more about Twine and using the Chapbook format.</p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>What is a Trail Guide?</h2>
<p>We use the term “trail guide” to describe this resource because most of what you’ll find here are not “tutorials”, “lessons”, or “directions”—instead, you’ll find a <em>Map</em> and some <em>Trails</em>.</p>
<h3>Using the Map</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="https://padlet.com/jonstapleton/wvs5vb5ct1s5kqts" rel="nofollow">Region Map</a></strong> contains a bunch of short little lessons on how to do different things with <strong>Twine</strong>. You don’t have to follow these lessons in any particular order; once you know a little bit about <strong>Twine</strong>, you will probably find it useful to just browse around and explore the things that you might want to learn about as you work on writing a story.</p>
<h3>Following the Trails</h3>
<p>The Map is useful, but sometimes it’s also helpful to have a path to follow so you can learn the basics without having to dig around. <strong>Trails</strong> are sequences of lessons that we’ve created from the lessons on the Map that you can follow (if you want).</p>
<p>Each Trail is designed to help you make something. You can follow the lessons on your chosen Trail in order, and even complete a little mini-project at the end to practice your skills.</p>
<p>There are lots of Trails to choose from.</p></div>
<div class="section"><h2>How to Use the Trail Guide</h2>
<p>This <em>Trail Guide</em> is a tool for you to use, one that is intended to help you create stories with <strong>Twine</strong>. You can use it in whatever way you find helpful, but here are some suggestions:</p>
<ol><li>If you’re new to <strong>Twine</strong>, go check out the <a href="/twine-trail-guide/trails">trails</a> and pick one to follow. We suggest the <a href="#">“My First Story”</a> trail.</li>
<li>Complete the mini-project at the end of your chosen trail. Bask in your achievement, and share your story with friends &amp; family!</li>
<li>Pick a new <a href="/twine-trail-guide/trails">trail</a> that seems interesting to you, or go explore the <a href="https://padlet.com/jonstapleton/wvs5vb5ct1s5kqts" rel="nofollow">region map</a>. Add to your first story, or start a new one!</li>
<li>Keep going—make stories!</li></ol></div>
