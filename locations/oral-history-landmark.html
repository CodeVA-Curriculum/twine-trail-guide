                <p class="block">Oral histories are accounts of historical events from one person's perspective, told in their own words. To create an oral history, an interviewer sits down with the subject and asks them questions about their life and events from their past. This project shows how you can turn an oral history into an interactive Twine story that incorporates audio recordings from an oral history interview.</p>

    <section class="content post post-container svelte-16we498"><h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>For this project, you’ll interview someone about events from their past personal experiences. Then, you’ll embed pieces of those recordings in a Twine story, allowing the reader to explore and investigate different parts of the interview subject’s experiences. Each passage will feature a short snippet of audio, followed by a series of choices for the reader that lead to new audio snippets. The reader might choose what questions to ask next, or play the role of the “interviewer” as they read through your Twine story. <a href="" rel="nofollow">Storycorps</a> has a couple of great examples of recorded conversations</p>
<hr>
<h2>How To</h2>
<p>First, you’ll need to find someone to interview. Usually, oral histories involve interviewing someone who experienced a particular event in history in a personal way. You may want to interview a grandparent who participated in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement, someone who fought in a war, or someone who participated in the fight for LGBTQ+ civil rights during the AIDS crisis. You can also interview people who experienced historical moments in your town or state history. Ultimately, the choice is yours—everyone has a story to tell!</p>
<p>Next, plan out the questions you’ll ask during the interview. You can read some tips from Storycorps <a href="" rel="nofollow">here</a>. Here are some other suggestions:</p>
<ul><li>Think about the goals you want to achieve in your interview—what do you want the subject to talk about?</li>
<li>What different perspectives do you want to touch on in Twine story? Is there a way to get your subject to talk about different aspects of the same event?</li>
<li>What might the reader take away from your story in the end? How might you get your subject to speak on that topic?</li>
<li>Ask lots of questions—twice as many as you think you’ll need.</li></ul>
<p>Once you’ve planned out your interview, record your conversation with the subject. Then, start working on your story. You can follow the steps below to work on your project if you’re having trouble knowing what to do next:</p>
<ol><li>Listen to your interview, and make note of important pieces of story or audio snippets you want the reader to listen to. These snippets will be your passages.</li>
<li>Edit your audio so the different snippets for each passage are in their own file. Set up <a href="" rel="">hosting</a> for your files as appropriate.</li>
<li>Open the Twine story editor and <a href="" rel="">create a passage</a> for each snippet of audio.</li>
<li><a href="" rel="">Add the appropriate audio snippets</a> to each passage.</li>
<li>Find connections between the audio snippets, and start creating <a href="" rel="">branching paths</a> between them.</li>
<li>Use <a href="" rel="">delay text</a> to show important information synced with the audio playing the background. Some readers may have trouble following the sound, and it’s always a good idea to provide text in addition to sound whenever possible.</li>
<li>Add new passages to help the story flow better.</li></ol>
<hr>
<h2>Save Your Work</h2>
<p>Twine saves your work in your browser, but that’s not a very secure way to keep your story safe. To create a secure and permanent version of your story, click the name of your story in the bottom-left of the story editor and select <code>Publish to File</code>. The file that your computer saves when you click that button is a portable version of your story that you can send to other people and keep for yourself.</p>
<p>

<div style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><figure class="image is-inline-block"><img alt="The Twine story editor showing the 'Publish to File' button that allows the author to download their story in HTML format" src="/twine-trail-guide/images/publish-to-file.png" class="svelte-r75zci"></figure></div>


</p>
<p>Make sure you save your work!</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Here are some common problems people run into when they are first starting out with Twine:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Link Name Typos:</strong> Whenever you make a link, the name has to match another passage in your story. If it doesn’t Twine will create a <em>new</em> passage with the name of your mispelled link. Double-check your spelling to avoid confusion</li>
<li><strong>Not Testing Often:</strong> You should test your code as <em>often as possible</em>. Testing your story frequently will help you catch errors before they pile up and become difficult to fix</li>
<li><strong>Link Format Errors:</strong> All of your links need to follow the same format: <code>&gt; [[passage-name]]</code>, with the name of one of your passages in place of <code>passage-name</code>. There are some <a href="" rel="nofollow">other kinds of links</a> that also work, but I recommend sticking with the “normal” way until you get comfortable recognizing errors</li>
<li><strong>Spaces and Capitalization:</strong> Twine keeps track of spacing and capitalization, so make sure you pay attention to it as well (especially with passage names)</li>
<li><strong>Trouble with Audio:</strong> Follow the instructions for hosting and embedding the audio carefully. It’s tricky!</li></ul>
