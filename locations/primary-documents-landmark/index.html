    <section class="content post post-container svelte-16we498"><h2>About the Project</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to create an interactive story based on the materials in the <a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/" rel="nofollow">Library of Virginia’s</a> collections. The <a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/" rel="nofollow">LoV</a> has a <em>ton</em> of amazing documents from Virginia history, and all of them tell a story about things that happened in the past—things that shape our present moment.</p>
<p>For this project, you’ll create a Twine project using information from the <a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/" rel="nofollow">LoV</a> archives. As the reader plays through your story, they should feel like they are investigating a mystery hidden in these documents. You should include pictures of the documents, as well as the people and places they document, in your Twine passages to help the reader understand the story. <a href="/locations/reveal-text">“Reveal” links</a> are a great way of helping the reader feel like they are uncovering information about an artifact.</p>
<p>At the end of your story, the reader should have learned something new about a person, place, or event from the past.</p>
<hr>
<h2>How To</h2>
<p>First, you should decide what your story will be about. Browse through the <a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/" rel="nofollow">Library of Virginia</a> collections and find something interesting! There are a lot of things to try, so here are some suggestions to get you started:</p>
<ul><li>Pick a person to write about</li>
<li>Pick an event</li>
<li>Pick a place (maps?)</li></ul>
<p>Next, pick a few <em>primary documents</em> from the collection that you chose. Primary documents are artifacts from the past that record an event based on first-hand knowledge from someone who was there. You can also use some <em>secondary</em> documents if you want; these are second-hand accounts of an event (like a newspaper article written by a reporter).</p>
<p>You might find it useful to start with some pre-made collections of documents instead of searching through the whole archive; here are some ideas:</p>
<ul><li>Search for a biography in the <a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/changemakers/items/browse?item_type=person" rel="nofollow">Changemakers</a> collections.</li>
<li>Tell a story from the <a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/virginia-women-in-history/digitaltrails/" rel="nofollow">Virginia Women in History Digital Trails</a></li>
<li>Tell the story of the fight for Civil Rights in Virginia using resources from the <a href="https://edu.lva.virginia.gov/dbva/items/browse?tags=Reform+Movements" rel="nofollow">Library of Virginia Document Bank</a>.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, plan out your story. Here are some questions that it might be useful to ask yourself:</p>
<ul><li>What mystery could the reader try to solve?</li>
<li>Who is the story about?</li>
<li>How are the documents connected, and how might I show those connections to the reader?</li></ul>
<p>You’ll probably have to read the documents to get a good sense of how they fit together, and what information the reader might uncover as they play through your story.</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines to help you design your Twine story around your chosen primary documents:</p>
<ol><li>Create one passage for each document you want the reader to explore. Include an image of the document in that passage.</li>
<li>Use <a href="/locations/reveal-text">reveal links</a> to show information about the document as the reader clicks around. Have them uncover more details as they click through different links.</li>
<li>When the reader reveals information that leads to another document, create a <a href="/locations/link-passages">link</a> to a new passage showing the next document.</li>
<li>Be sure to build in links to at least two documents in each passage if you can!</li></ol>
<hr>
<h2>Save Your Work</h2>
<p>Twine saves your work in your browser, but that’s not a very secure way to keep your story safe. To create a secure and permanent version of your story, click the name of your story in the bottom-left of the story editor and select <code>Publish to File</code>. The file that your computer saves when you click that button is a portable version of your story that you can send to other people and keep for yourself.</p>
<p>

<div class="has-text-left"><figure class="image is-inline-block"><img alt="The Twine story editor showing the &#39;Publish to File&#39; button that allows the author to download their story in HTML format" src="/images/publish-to-file.png" class="svelte-r75zci"></figure></div>


</p>
<p>Make sure you save your work!</p>
<hr>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<ul><li>Quotation marks in images and reveal links</li>
<li><strong>Link Name Typos:</strong> Whenever you make a link, the name has to match another passage in your story. If it doesn’t Twine will create a <em>new</em> passage with the name of your mispelled link. Double-check your spelling to avoid confusion</li>
<li><strong>Not Testing Often:</strong> You should test your code as <em>often as possible</em>. Testing your story frequently will help you catch errors before they pile up and become difficult to fix</li>
<li><strong>Spaces and Capitalization:</strong> Twine keeps track of spacing and capitalization, so make sure you pay attention to it as well (especially with passage names)</li>
<li><strong>Image Problems:</strong> Be sure to put your image link url inside <code>&#39;&#39;</code>, and don’t forget to include alt text as well! Follow the examples in the <a href="/locations/adding-images">“Adding Images”</a> tutorial if you have trouble.</li></ul>
