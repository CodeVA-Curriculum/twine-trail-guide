## First, Visit Twine in Your Web Browser

[Twine](https://twinery.org/) is a set of tools that help people write interactive stories and programs that run in a web browser. There are lots of ways to use these tools (including installing the tools on your computer so you can use them offline), but the *easiest* way is to just open Twine in your web browser.

1. Follow [this link](https://twinery.org/) to open the Twine website.
2. Find the link that says `Use it online` on the right side of the screen (see the screenshot below). Click the link to open the Twine editor tool.

## Then, Select the Chapbook Format

Twine **formats** control the appearance and style of the stories you create using Twine's tools. We suggest using **Chapbook** (that's the one we will use in our examples in this trail guide). **The examples in this guide only work for Chapbook!**

1. Click `Twine` tab in the area near the top-left of the screen (see the screenshot below)

2. Click the `Story Formats` button to open the story formats menu

2. Click the **Chapbook** box to highlight it, and then click `Use as Default Format` near the top of the screen.

Click the `Back` button near the top-left corner of the screen to return to the main page.

## Finally, Make Your Story

1. From the main page, find the `+ New` button near the top-left of the screen, and give it a click!

2. Name your story whatever you'd like. If you can't think of a name, just name it `My First Story`. You can change it later if you'd like. Then, click `Create`.

3. Twine will automatically open the editor after it creates your story. To see how to add to your story, check out the [tutorial on creating passages](/locations/create-passage). To return to the main page, click the `Back` button in the top-left corner of the screen.

4. You can re-enter your story to make changes by selecting the story box from the main page and clicking the `Edit` button near the top-left side of the screen.
