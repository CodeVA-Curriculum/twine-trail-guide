title: Archeological Puzzle
difficulty: 2
description: In this trail, you'll learn how to write stories where the computer hides or displays sections of passages based on the value of variables, which are invisible to the reader. The **conditional control structures** which make this possible are very useful for creating stories where the reader needs to investigate something or solve a puzzle before having access to the next part of the narrative. At the end, you'll create a story that prompts the reader to solve a puzzle as they explore a historical location.

:::aside
Before working on this trail, you should be at least a little bit familiar with the basics of Twine--how to make passages, link them together, and create branching paths to make a story with multiple possible endings. You should also be familiar with creating and modifying variables. If you aren't familiar with these concepts, feel free to review the *[Your First Story](/trails/your-first-story)* before you start with this one.
