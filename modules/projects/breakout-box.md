title: Breakout Box
difficulty: 2
description: In this trail, you'll learn how to write stories where the computer hides or displays sections of passages based on the value of variables, which are invisible to the reader. The **conditional control structures** which make this possible are very useful for creating stories where the reader needs to investigate something or solve a puzzle before having access to the next part of the narrative. At the end, you'll create a "puzzle box" game about a historical figure. The reader should use their knowledge of history and clues hidden in the story to advance through the puzzle, eventually "unlocking" the identity of the figure in question.

Before working on this trail, you should be at least a little bit familiar with the basics of Twine--how to make passages, link them together, and create branching paths to make a story with multiple possible endings. You should also be familiar with creating and modifying variables. If you aren't familiar with these concepts, feel free to review the *[Your First Story](/trails/your-first-story)* before you start with this one.
