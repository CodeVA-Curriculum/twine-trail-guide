description: In this trail, you'll learn to use variables to create a story where characters "remember" you, and react to your choices in the story. Creating stories that change based on what the user does is a great way to make your narrative seem more lifelike, making the user feel as though they are interacting with a real world populated by real people. Follow this trail to learn the basics of creating, using, and modifying the values of variables in your stories!

Before working on this trail, you should be at least a little bit familiar with the basics of Twine--how to make passages, link them together, and create branching paths to make a story with multiple possible endings. If you aren't sure, feel free to review the *[Your First Story](/trails/your-first-story)* trail before you start with this one.
