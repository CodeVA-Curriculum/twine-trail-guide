title: Counting Story
author: Jon Stapleton
description: In this trail, you'll create a story where the computer keeps track of a number value "behind the scenes"--a value that changes over time based on the events in the story. Using variables to store number values has several interesting applications; you can create a story that keeps track of a score, a story where the reader needs to collect things, or any number of other "game-like" reading experiences. In the project at the end of this trail, you'll create a story that explores an important moment in American history where people voted on an issue.

Before working on this trail, you should be at least a little bit familiar with the basics of Twine--how to make passages, link them together, and create branching paths to make a story with multiple possible endings. If you aren't sure, feel free to review the *[Your First Story](/trails/your-first-story)* trail before you start with this one.
