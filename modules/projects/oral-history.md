This trail will help you understand how to record audio and include it in your Twine stories. The project at the end of this trail is an oral history--a record of someone's experiences as told by them, written down so people in the future can learn about the person's life. In this oral history, you'll include audio recordings of the person delivering the oral history in addition to offering the reader some choices to help them explore the history of the person you interview.

In the Twine project you create, the reader will play the part of the interviewer, choosing questions to ask the subject and listening to their responses. Each of your passages will include an audio recording of the subject's answer to the question the reader chose.
