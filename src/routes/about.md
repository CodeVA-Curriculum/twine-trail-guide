# About the Guide

This site is a guide intended to help people use (or teach others to use) [**Twine**](#). **Twine** is a tool for creating websites, but instead of the website being about a topic, or hosting a storefront, or containing blog posts, **Twine** websites tell **stories**.

## What is a Trail Guide?

We use the term "trail guide" to describe this resource because most of what you'll find here are not "tutorials", "lessons", or "directions"--instead, you'll find a *Map* and some *Trails*.

### Using the Map

The **Map** contains a bunch of short little lessons on how to do different things with **Twine**. You don't have to follow these lessons in any particular order; once you know a little bit about **Twine**, you will probably find it useful to just browse around and explore the things that you might want to learn about as you work on writing a story.

### Following the Trails

The Map is useful, but sometimes it's also helpful to have a path to follow so you can learn the basics without having to dig around. **Trails** are sequences of lessons that we've created from the lessons on the Map that you can follow (if you want). 

Each Trail is designed to help you make something. You can follow the lessons on your chosen Trail in order, and even complete a little mini-project at the end to practice your skills.

There are lots of Trails to choose from.

## How to Use the Trail Guide

This *Trail Guide* is a tool for you to use, one that is intended to help you create stories with **Twine**. You can use it in whatever way you find helpful, but here are some suggestions:

1. If you're new to **Twine**, go check out the [trails]({base}/trails) and pick one to follow. We suggest the ["My First Story"](#) trail.
2. Complete the mini-project at the end of your chosen trail. Bask in your achievement, and share your story with friends & family!
3. Pick a new [trail]({base}/trails) that seems interesting to you, or go explore the [map]({base}/map). Add to your first story, or start a new one!
4. Keep going--make stories!
