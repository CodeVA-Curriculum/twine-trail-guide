title: Relational Expressions
author: Jon Stapleton
short: Learn how to write relational expressions
description: Relational expressions (or "Boolean" expressions) are a way of having the computer compare two or more values and produce a value of "true" or "false" based on the comparison. Because "true" and "false" variable values are such an important part of "if" statements and other conditional control structures, you'll find lots of uses for relational expressions in your stories that use "if" and "unless" blocks.
