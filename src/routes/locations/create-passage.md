## Open the Editor

The story **editor** is where you can create and edit the passages that make up your story. To begin editing one of your Twine stories, click on it from the home screen:

![The home Twine page, with a cursor hovering over a story](/twine-select-story.png "Edit your story by clicking on it from the home page")

When you click on the story, the Twine **story editor** will open, and you'll see a box in the center called "Untitled Passage".

## Test the Story

Twine starts your story with a default passage. You can change the default passage if you'd like, but first go ahead and test it out to see how Twine shows the story. Click the `Play` button in the bottom-right corner of the editor to test the story.

You'll notice that Twine opens a new tab for you, with a black background and white text that says:

> Double-click this passage to edit it.

When you create a Twine story, this tab is what your reader will see. They won't be able to see the editor page with all your passages--those will remain secret.

This isn't a good story yet, so close the story tab and go back to the story editor to make some changes.

## Delete a Passage

Go ahead and delete the "Untitled Passage" so you can practice making your own. Hover your mouse over the box, and click the `trash` icon.

When you choose to delete a passage, a box will pop up asking you if you want to continue. It's very important to think carefully about deleting your passages--you can't recover them once they are gone. Click `Delete` to delete the "Untitled Passage" from your story.

## Add a New Passage

To create a new passage, click the green `+ Passage` button in the bottom-right corner of the screen

![The Twine story editor with an arrow pointing toward the 'New Passage' button](/new-passage.png)

You'll see a new "Untitled Passage" box. This time, don't delete it--instead, you can edit it to start adding to your story.

## Edit a Passage

To edit a passage, hover over it and click the `pencil` icon.

![The Twine story editor, showing the contextual menu that comes up with the author hovers the mouse of a passage](/passage-hover.png)

You'll see a box pop up that says `Double-click this passage to edit it`. Delete the message, and type something else. This will be the first sentence of your story! You can start it right away, or you can just type something short for now. You can also change the name of the passage by changing the text that says `Untitled Passage` at the top of the editor to something else.

Once you're done, click the `X` in the top-right corner, or click outside of the passage editor on the dark background to return to the story editor.

## Test Your Changes

Now, test your story again--click the `Play` button at the bottom-right of the editor. You should see your new text instead of the default text this time. You've edited your story! You can add as much text as you'd like, but don't type your whole story into the passage--Twine is about creating *many* passages that are *linked together*.
