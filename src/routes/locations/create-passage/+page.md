title: Create a Passage
author: Jon Stapleton
short: Learn how to create a passage in Twine, telling a part of your story using text.
description: Passages are where the action happens--they make up the parts of your story. This tutorial covers how to create a passage using the Twine editor, and how to add text to that passage to tell part of your story to the reader.

## Open the Editor

The story **editor** is where you can create and edit the passages that make up your story. To begin editing one of your Twine stories, click on it from the home screen and click the `Edit` button above:

When you click on the story, the Twine **story editor** will open, and you'll see a box in the center called "Untitled Passage".

## Test the Story

Twine starts your story with a default passage. You can tell which passage is the starting point because it's connected to a green rocket ship icon:

You can change the default passage if you'd like, but first go ahead and test it out to see how Twine shows the story. To test the story, click the `Build` tab near the top-right of the editor, and then click the `Play` button (or the `Test` button--they both work).

You'll notice that Twine opens a new tab for you showing a blank white page:

When you create a Twine story, this tab is what your reader will see. They won't be able to see the editor page with all your passages and code--those will remain secret.

This isn't really a story yet (we need some words, at least), so close the story tab and go back to the story editor to make some changes.

## Edit a Passage

To edit a passage and add words to your story, click it, select the `Passage` tab in the editor, and click the `Edit` button. You can also just double-click the passage (that's probably faster and easier in most cases):

You'll see a box pop up with a large empty text entry area, and some buttons (see the screenshot below). This is the **Passage Editor**. Type something into the box; this will be the first sentence of your story! You can just type something short for now and add to it later. You can also change the name of the passage by changing the text that says `Untitled Passage` at the top of the editor to something else, if you'd like

Once you're done, click the `X` in the top-right corner of the Passage Editor to return to the story editor.

## Test Your Changes

Now, test your story again--click the `Build` tab and then `Play` button near the top-left corner of the editor window. You should see your new text instead of the blank page this time. You've edited your story! You can add as much text as you'd like, but don't type your whole story into one passage--Twine is about creating *many* passages that are *linked together*.

## Add a New Passage

To create a new passage, click the green `+New` button in the top-left area of the editor.

![The Twine story editor with an arrow pointing toward the '+New' button](/new-passage.png)

You'll see a new "Untitled Passage" box. You can drag it around the editor and edit it following the process described above, but you won't see it in your story if you test it out. You'll learn how to [link this passage to your starting passage](/locations/link-passages) in another tutorial.

## Delete a Passage

Go ahead and delete new passage you made, just for practice. Click the passage, make sure you're on the `Passage` tab, and click `Delete`. It's very important to think carefully about deleting your passages--you can't recover them once they are gone.
