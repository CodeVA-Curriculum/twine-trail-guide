author: Jon Stapleton
short: Learn how to make audio recordings accessible to websites like Twine stories.
description: Your Twine stories are websites, which means whoever is reading them needs to download the whole story (including all its images, video, and audio) when they want to read it. In order for them to get access to audio you want to include in the story, you'll need to host that audio on a web server. This tutorial shows you how.

## What Is Hosting?

"Hosting" a webpage or a file means that you've made it accessible to other people connected to the internet by "hosting" the file on a server (a computer set up to send files to people over the internet). Any website you access with your computer is being hosted by a server somewhere in the world.

Websites are made up of files, and when you visit a site online the server sends you the files you need. A lot of times, the server needs to send you *many* files for the webpage to load properly. There are HTML, CSS, and Javascript files which make up the webpage itself, but there are often also image, video, and audio files that you need to download in order to show the proper information on the webpage.
