short: Combine relational expressions with logic operators.
description: When you write stories that include conditional control structures, you might find yourself wanting to have the computer display or hide text based on more than one condition. For example, you might want to offer the reader an option to pick up a key from the floor of a dark room, but only if they haven't already picked it up and they have found the flashlight beforehand. You can use logical operations to accomplish this kind of task.
