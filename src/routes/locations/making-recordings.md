## Pick a Recording Application

In order to create an audio recording, you'll need to use some software on a computer or a smartphone. Here are some options:

<!-- TODO: do research on apps to use -->
* **iOS:** The Voice Memos app
* **Android:** [find a thing]
* **Windows:** [open source audio recorder], a free audio recording application
* **Mac:** Garageband, a audio workstation that's built into MacOS
* **ChromeOS:** Soundtrap

## Recording Sounds

Audio recording can be pretty tricky, but you don't need to be perfect to be successful. Here are some simple tips for recording sounds with inexpensive equipment:

* Hold the microphone or device recording the audio at the height of the source of the sound. If you're sitting at a table interviewing someone using a smartphone, consider putting the phone between the two of you on a short stack of books to get the mic closer to head-level.
* Don't hold the microphone too close--you don't want the mic to catch any strong gusts of breath. Unless you're using a fancy microphone, about 2 feet of distance is usually fine.
* Record in a quiet room that doesn't echo too much. Bathrooms are particularly echo-y, while rooms with books on the walls are usually great. Recording outside is even better, if you can make sure there won't be too much noise from cars or animals.

You don't really need a nice microphone to record audio, especially if you're just recording someone's voice. A smartphone will work just fine for that. If you want to record music, sounds from the outdoors, or something like that, then you may find it useful to use a dedicated microphone to use with your [smartphone](TODO: find link) or [computer](TODO: find link). You don't *need* it, but it will make life a little easier.

Different recording applications have slightly different processes for capturing the sound. Here are some tutorials to check out for the applications I've suggested above:

## Export Your Audio

Once you've recorded your sounds, you'll need to *export* them as a particular kind of audio file. There are lots of kinds of audio files out there, with different sizes and levels of quality. For Twine projects, the best format is `.mp3`. Here are some tutorials to show you how to export `.mp3` files for the applications above:

Once you have your file, keep track of it--you'll need it if you add audio to your Twine story.
