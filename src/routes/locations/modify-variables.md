short: Write code to modify the value of variables.
description: In this tutorial, you'll learn how to write code in your passage to modify the value of variables across your story. Variables are a very flexible tool for crafting your stories, but they can also be tricky. It's important to have a good mental model of how they work so you can use them creatively in your narratives. Once you know how to modify variables, you can have your story react to the choices the reader makes, and change how the story is being told "behind the scenes", making your narrative feel interactive and lifelike.
