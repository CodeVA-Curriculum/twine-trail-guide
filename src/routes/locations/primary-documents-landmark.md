title: Primary Documents
# TODO: incorporate author into location cards
author: Jon Stapleton
short: Create a story where the reader explores primary documents from a moment in history.
description: In this project, you'll use the Library of Virginia collections to find primary documents about a moment in history or a person from the past. Use the primary documents as the basis of a story, where the reader must investigate the documents to move the story forward. Use images and reveal links to make the reader feel like they are uncovering a mystery.
