## About the Project

## How To

First, **pick a historical location**. You should choose places that have lots of recorded history you can dig into and research, and your chosen location should also "make sense" as an archeological site--somewhere there might be things to discover and uncover. Here are some ideas (but you should choose your own; don't limit yourself to items from the list below unless you can't think of anything):

* The Qutub Minar in Delhi, India
* The Gjellestad site in Norway
* The Budj Bim heritage areas in Victoria, Australia
* The Valley of the Kings near Thebes, Egypt
* Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania
* Machu Picchu in Peru
* The Montpelier Estate in Virginia, USA
* Mesa Verde in New Mexico, USA

Next, design a story where the reader investigates the historical site and learns about the people who lived there and the events that took place there in the past. Make sure that you think carefully about how they should go about this process; you should consider the following:

* What were the experiences of indigenous peoples in your chosen location?
* How is this place a part of people's (e.g., indigenous peoples) lives in modern times? How does it hold cultural significance for a community of people today?
* Did colonization play a role in events that transpired at your chosen location?
* What sorts of harms have been perpetrated by archeologists at your location in the past?
* Whose voice should be elevated in the telling of your chosen location's story? How might you elevate their voices in your narrative?

As you design your story, think about how you might use conditional statements to let the reader "unlock" new portions of the narrative through choices they make. By the end, your story should include the following:

* Variables that change in value over the course of the story
* Conditional statements that let the reader "unlock" new parts of the story as they make choices
* A narrative that communicates information about the historical site, especially information about the people who lived there and events that transpired there
