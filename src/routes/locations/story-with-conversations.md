title: Story With Conversations
author: Jon Stapleton
short: A project where the reader's choices affect the words characters say to the reader and one another.
description: One of the great things about interactive narratives is the possibility for the story to respond to the choices the reader makes. One way to make your interactive narrative feel life-like is to use variables to change what different characters say based on what the reader does in the story. This project prompts you to create a story about a big event in history, and try to imagine what the people there would say to one another. As the reader discovers more information, the characters' scripts should change to reveal more information about their inner thoughts, their lives, and how they are making sense of the historical moment they are living in.
