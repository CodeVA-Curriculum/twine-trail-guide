## About the Project

For this project, you'll use your Twine skills to create a simple story with more than one possible endings. During the story, the reader should have to make choices that lead to different outcomes in the story. You could have your reader choose different locations to visit, choose to talk to different people, or even choose to have the main character "say" different things to affect what happens next in the story. The story should have a couple of different "endings", where events stop and there are no links that lead to a new passage.

## How To

First, you should think of a story to write. Your story should have a setting and a main character who has to deal with some sort of problem or challenge during the story. Here are a couple of ideas:

* The main character is lost in a spooky haunted house, and must choose the right path to escape from the house before they are caught by whatever creature lives inside
* The main character is a detective at a dinner party, and must solve a mystery before the end of the night
* The main character is a sailor dealing with a sudden emergency at sea

Once you have an idea for your story, you can either start writing or plan out your passages and links in advance. I like using sticky notes to get an idea of my story before I start writing too much, but you can do whatever works best for you.

Here are some tips to keep in mind as you work:

* Keep your passages short and descriptive. Make sure you give the reader enough information for them to imagine the story in their head as they read
* Try to give the reader a couple of different kinds of choices to make. Choosing between two places to go is the easiest, but try adding some other kinds of options as well
* Don't add too many links to one scene--keep it simple

### Save Your Work

Twine saves your work in your browser, but that's not a very secure way to keep your story safe. To create a secure and permanent version of your story, click the name of your story in the bottom-left of the story editor and select `Publish to File`. The file that your computer saves when you click that button is a portable version of your story that you can send to other people and keep for yourself.

Make sure you save your work!

### Troubleshooting

Here are some common problems people run into when they are first starting out with Twine:

* **Link Name Typos:** Whenever you make a link, the name has to match another passage in your story. If it doesn't Twine will create a *new* passage with the name of your mispelled link. Double-check your spelling to avoid confusion
* **Not Testing Often:** You should test your code as *often as possible*. Testing your story frequently will help you catch errors before they pile up and become difficult to fix
* **Link Format Errors:** All of your links need to follow the same format: `> [[passage-name]]`, with the name of one of your passages in place of `passage-name`. There are some [other kinds of links](https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/guide/text-and-links/simple-links.html) that also work, but I recommend sticking with the "normal" way until you get comfortable recognizing errors
* **Spaces and Capitalization:** Twine keeps track of spacing and capitalization, so make sure you pay attention to it as well (especially with passage names)
