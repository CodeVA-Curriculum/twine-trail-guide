title: Primary Documents
difficulty: 2
# TODO: parse description as markdown
description: Create a Twine story that uses primary documents--pieces of writing or recordings made by people who experienced a particular event from the past--to help the reader discover information about an event from the past. This project makes use of the Library of Virginia's collections as a source of primary documents that tell stories about people from Virginia. You'll connect those documents together to tell a story.

The goal of this trail is to create a Twine story that incorporates *primary documents*, telling a story about the past using materials from that history. In order to incorporate these primary documents, you'll need to learn how to [add images]({base}/locations/adding-images) from the web to your stories. You'll also need to figure out some interesting ways of putting these images together by writing a story to go with them. 

In the end, your reader should feel like they are investigating a mystery, poring over these documents and imagining what it was like to live during the moments they describe.

<!-- This works for all locations! -->

Before working on this trail, you should be at least a little bit familiar with the basics of Twine--how to make passages, link them together, and create branching paths to make a story with multiple possible endings. If you aren't sure, feel free to review the "Your First Story" trail before you start with this one.
